# eco-sustainability-docs

This repository will host a Docusaurus-powered documentation site focused on eco-friendly concepts, sustainable materials, and simple DIY projects. The goal is to create clear, educational content that helps people learn about low-waste design principles and responsible material choices.

The site will be generated using Docusaurus and deployed using GitHub Pages.

More updates coming soon as the documentation structure is built.
